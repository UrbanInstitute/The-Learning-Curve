In order to reproduce the analysis in Joshua Bleiberg's "The Rapid Increase of School Accountability during the Pandemic," the viewer needs to download both "analysis.do" and "analysis.zip" to the same location. Within "analysis.do," change line 16 to reflect the desired working directory, and run to produce visuals and analyses. Note, the author generates some analyses using school level observations; please reach out to Dr. Josh Bleiberg at jbleiber@pitt.edu for those datasets.
