Data for Elc Estrera's "Do Active Shooter Drills hurt student outcomes?" is not publicly available, and data cleaning scripts are not shareable. However, scripts for both manipulating cleaned data and producing analysis figures are shared here. The process for doing so is described here:

- Download master.do
- Download analysis.zip
- Edit line 11 in order to reflect the directory where raw data and final outputs should be produced
