<h2>Organization</h2>

Blog Posts are organized by release date. Directories are organized accordingly:
- {week_of_release_date}-{blog_topic}

For example, 2021_11_07-school_police_officers_and_social_workers will contain the analysis script and instructions for organizing all files and directories in order to reproduce the analysis in the publication. Most directories will be structured according to the following schema:

- Programs
  - All relevant scripts
- readme.md with instructions on how to organize files, install any packages or dependencies, and download data that is not automatically downloaded by the analysis.
