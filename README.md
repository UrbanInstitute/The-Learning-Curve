##The Learning Curve

The Learning Curve is an Urban Institute blog in which internal and external researchers publish short form pieces (~2000 words) focused on education policy. Blog posts will primarily feature quantitative analysis, with a focus on easy-to-parse analytics.

##Organization

Blog Posts are organized by release date. Directories are organized accordingly:
- {week_of_release_date}-{blog_topic}

For example, 2021_11_07-school_police_officers_and_social_workers will contain the analysis script and instructions for organizing all files and directories in order to reproduce the analysis in the publication. Most Directories will be structured according to the following schema:

- Programs
  - All relevant scripts
- readme.md with instructions on how to organize files, install any packages or dependencies, and download data that is not automatically downloaded by the analysis.
