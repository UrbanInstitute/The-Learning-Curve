In order to reproduce the analysis in Jason Cohn's "How Many Short Term Training Programs Would Gain Access to Pell Grants Under New Proposal?," three steps need to take place:
1. Download the "analysis.do"
2. Change line 5 to be the directory in which you are working out off
3. Run lines 1-22, which will create the folders that hold both input and output data
4. Download the data file from [here](doc:https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=70&step=1&acrdn=8#eyJhcHBpZCI6NzAsInN0ZXBzIjpbMSwyNCwyOSwyNSwzMSwyNiwyNywzMCwzMF0sImRhdGEiOltbIlRhYmxlSWQiLCIxMDEiXSxbIkNsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9uIiwiTm9uLUluZHVzdHJ5Il0sWyJNYWpvcl9BcmVhIiwiMCJdLFsiU3RhdGUiLFsiMCJdXSxbIkFyZWEiLFsiWFgiXV0sWyJTdGF0aXN0aWMiLCIxIl0sWyJVbml0X29mX21lYXN1cmUiLCJMZXZlbHMiXSxbIlllYXIiLFsiMjAxOSJdXSxbIlllYXJCZWdpbiIsIi0xIl0sWyJZZWFyX0VuZCIsIi0xIl1dfQ==) and save a csv version of it in the Data/raw_data folder you specified above.

After completing the above 4 steps, you should be able to reproduce the analysis in the piece.
